Hi, This is Vishwas Jajpura a third Year Undergraduate student at IIT kharagpur.
Here we have a Sales data of an USA based company and we will process this data and try to find answers to 4 questions asked by sales and marketing team,which are:

1. What was the month where we had maximum sales?
2. What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
3. What products are often sold togather?
4. What product is sold the most and why do you think it is sold the most?
